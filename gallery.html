				<p class="image-1-caption"> Here are Malcolm and Marina Hervey looking phenomenal together at the Author&#39;s Roundtable dinner. The Roundtable is a charity event dedicated to reading-related events, resources, and other related initiatives across multiple counties in Tennessee. The event was held at the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022, where they raised a whopping total of over $80,000. The couple themselves donated $5000 to support the Southern Festival of Books in Nashville, Tennessee. They like to support community initiatives for sustaining the humanities for readers, taking every opportunity to both attend festivals and to give money to good causes. Book lovers unite! </p>

				<p class="image-2-caption"> This is the photo Malcolm uses most often to represent himself as an author. He describes himself here as &#8243;spooky, scary, and devilishly handsome&#8230;at the carnival.&#8243; To him, it&#39;s important for a horror author to be versatile, representing themselves as creepy for the fans but also being able to get professional so they don&#39;t scare the publishers. You can submit your own &#8243;spooky, scary, and devilishly handsome&#8243; photo on the <a href="../contact.html">Contact page</a> to be added to the community section of our Newsletter. </p>

				<p class="image-3-caption"> This photo features Malcolm at a book signing at The Dog Ear in Houston, Texas with a 14-year-old fan named Paisley Owen. Unbeknownst to the parents that drove her there to the signing, Paisley presented Malcolm with adoption papers in an attempt to fool him into adopting her. Unbeknownst to Paisley, the United States adoption process is a lot more complicated than that. We all had a great laugh about it though! Thanks, Paisley, and we hope you weren&#39;t in too much trouble with your parents! </p>
