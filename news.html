			<p>Malcolm Hervey is a young horror novelist who is quickly gaining popularity for his methods of evoking a sense of morality within tales of gruesome attacks and terrifying creatures. His newest novel, <cite>Jaywalkers,</cite> is due to come out May 19th. It&#39;s a story of a girl who attempts to face her fears, only to have them reasserted when she comes across something sinister. The little boy dubbed by the media as "Baby Genius" because of his young attendance at Harvard University and achievements in the science community has a message for Malcolm Hervey. Click the video for Baby Genius's opinion on <cite>Jaywalkers</cite>!</p>

			<h2>Your Checklist to Prepare for Big Book Bonanza in San Diego 2023</h2> <img src="../photos/Book_bonanza.jpg" alt="stack of books" class="bonanza"> <small><cite>Image from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/L27hLo9jTWY">Unsplash</a> from Markus Spiske at Bayreuth Festival Theatrea</cite></small>

			<p>We all know the feeling of going to an event for the first time and not really knowing what you&#39;re doing or how to be prepared. I&#39;ve definitely been there and if you&#39;re the prepared type like I am, you don&#39;t like the feeling of not knowing what to expect. That being said, here&#39;s a list of everything you need to do and have on you when you go: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>A backpack with a drawstring &#8211; You&#39;re going to need storage for any books or brochures you pick up from authors. The drawstring is a necessary tip my mom gave me as a teen for going into crowds. No one can reach behind you and unzip your pack without you realizing!</li>
				<li>Water &#8211; Big Book Bonanza is held outdoors and too many people think they&#39;re invincible when it comes to drinking water. It&#39;s going to be hot, and you absolutely need to stay hydrated.</li>
				<li>Cash &#8211; Some authors have cash-only book deals and there isn&#39;t easy access to an ATM on the festival grounds.</li>
				<li>Snacks &#8211; Festival food can be pricey and lacking nourishment. If you want to make sure that you will have food to fuel you for a long day of book perusing, bring some snacks! </li>
				<li>Sunscreen &#8211; I repeat, it&#39;s going to be hot! The sun is going to be out and for the average festival-goer, that means you will be in the sun for over five hours. Take care of your skin!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some extra tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Don&#39;t underestimate traffic &#8211; There will be a lot of people within the area and if you want to make it onto the festival grounds on time, leave a little early. </li>
				<li>Eat a nutritious breakfast and go to bed early the night before &#8211; Make sure you get your body what it needs for a full day of action.</li>
				<li>Don&#39;t be shy &#8211; There are hundreds of authors and thousands of fellow reading enthusiasts who will be at the festival. This is a really good opportunity to make a connection with your favorite author or a new friend!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Malcolm Hervey Talks About How a Biologist Becomes a YA Horror Novelist</h2> <img src="../photos/Biologist_to_novelist.jpg" alt="scientist in a lab doing an experiment" class="science">

			<p>Malcolm Hervey is an increasingly popular horror novelist from Chattanooga, Tennessee. He is the author of popular novels such as <cite>Didn&#39;t Bring a Change of Clothes</cite> and <cite>Family Vacation.</cite> Because of his insistence on being mysterious and remaining in a remote location, we&#39;ve managed to get him to answer some questions through email. Below is the transcription of that conversation:</p>
			<p>NW: Malcolm, I&#39;m very excited to finally talk to you, even if only virtually. First, I want to see if you have anything you&#39;d like to share about your new novel?</p>
			<p>MH: Yes, my new novel <cite>Jaywalkers</cite> will be in stores
				<time datetime="2023-05-19">May 19th</time>. I&#39;m really excited about this piece and everyone getting to read it because it really mixes the bizarre with the familiar. In my opinion, that is the creepiest stuff to read about. Something that you can relate so heavily to and then it all goes so wrong.</p>
			<p>NW: I agree, and we are all very excited to read it as soon as it comes out. Can you tell me a little about your career transition? How does one transition from YA horror novelist to forensic researcher?</p>
			<p>MH: I can break it down into three simple steps.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to college and study biological anthropology</li>
				<li>Have an identity crisis</li>
				<li>Write some books</li>
			</ol>
