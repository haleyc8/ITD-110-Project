		<p>Megan&#39;s troublesome past has led her to be a very cautious person. Her anxiety infects every aspect of her life, even the everyday tasks most people do not give a second thought. Getting up and getting ready for the day, making small talk with coworkers, making a morning commute&#8212;it&#39;s all a monumental task. When it comes to operating a vehicle, to her, it&#39;s not just a chore but unthinkable. After an unfortunate incident, Megan faces a more haunting hazard on the road than she could have ever imagined. She cannot escape from the torments of her own mind, coupled with whatever is lurking outside those yellow lines and just along the trees. Malcolm Hervey tells the horrific and suspenseful tale of a young woman named Megan, who is a hermit in her own right. Plagued with anxiety and antisocial tendencies, Megan doesn&#39;t have a singular person to come to her side when disaster strikes. As she becomes less willing to face what is in the outside world, we come to question everything just as she does. Is the coast clear? Is it safe? </p>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;That <em>thing</em> is out there, watching me, taunting me, thinking it&#39;s so funny. I don&#39;t know what it is, but I do know what I am. A coward. And I&#39;m staying the hell at home. I&#39;ll grow my own food, I&#39;ll buy livestock, I don&#39;t care anymore&#8230;I&#39;m done.&#8243; </p>
		<hr><p>She slid the chain lock into place, snapped the deadbolt, clicked the lock on the knob, then placed her door alarm in the sill. It had been 7 years today since the accident and she had since successfully shut herself away from the world. Megan was an anxious person with routines and safety checks and quite a bit of time to mull over things by herself. She paused at the door a moment and leaned forward to peek through the peep hole, seeing only a gray wall and empty hallway.</p>
		<p>&#8243;I guess it&#39;s time for bed,&#8243; she sighed and directed her sentiment to the 10-pound guard dog of a chihuahua she had adopted for company. He stared back at her from the couch, as if to say &#8243;It&#39;s 7 o&#39;clock,&#8243; then followed obediently when she started down the hall. The pair sat in the bed, listening to the city outside: police sirens, shouts, gunshots. She hated it. But she could walk to where she needed to go in the city when buildings were closer together. She was never going to get back into a car. She just wouldn&#39;t.</p>
		<p>She thought about it in that moment, as she did every time she closed her eyes to sleep. Megan, 16 years old at the time and excited to finally experience the freedom of the road, nodded her head along to some music as she rolled by. She experienced anxiety back then more than an average person likely did, but she was functional. It just meant that she was careful and looked where she was going. No phones, no distractions, and seatbelts always. She was on the highway going out to grab some groceries for her mom, the typical route for new drivers in her small town. Kids wanted the car, moms wanted to not run errands.</p>
		<p>She passed through a piece of road that connected a collection of wineries, breweries, and restaurants going at exactly the speed limit of 55 miles per hour. There was a group of young people barhopping, two boys and two girls who seemed to Megan to be in their early twenties. Megan saw them from a distance and felt a pang of nervousness at them being so close to the road, but kept going ahead. Unfortunately, they were already drunk enough to be too brave. One of the girls, leading the way for her group, tried to sprint across the road to their next destination at the very last second. Megan&#39;s breaks screeched as she tried desperately to avoid the girl. Everyone attempted to tell her that there was an oncoming car on her right, a group of people on her left, and a pedestrian in her lane. There was no way to avoid a tragedy, but she still felt it deeply every day. Megan had done everything right, but all still went so wrong. </p></div>
