		<h1>Meet the Author</h1>
		<h2>Malcolm Hervey</h2>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;Malcolm always had a strangely keen sense of the spirit realm and all things occult. He drew pictures of strange creatures and told stories of rituals and people making sacrifices, starting when he was maybe only 7 or 8. We honestly were kind of worried.&#8243; &#8211; Lena Hervey aka Malcolm&#39;s mom, age 58, Tennessee</p>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;Hervey&#39;s novel Hospice honestly changed my life. My mother is 76 and my dad is 77. Reading about Inez&#39;s difficulty facing the fact of death, along with an unsupportive family and dealing with trauma, really made me think about how my behavior was negatively affecting my own aging parents. Thank you for teaching a lesson while scaring the pants off me at the same time!&#8243; &#8211; Mona Rutkins of <cite>The Harvard Review</cite>, age 43, Oklahoma</p>
		<p>Malcolm John Hervey was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on March 19, 1995. He is the son of John and Lena Hervey and the youngest brother to Chris, Jack, Ethan, and Paul Hervey. Malcolm was what Lena and John describe as a &#8243;happy little accident,&#8243; as the other boys were pre-teen to teenage by the time he was born. Being the younger brother was difficult and Malcolm cited creativity as his primary tool for survival. After a while of enduring typical brotherly bullying, Malcolm got smart and strategic when it came to escaping. A famous example of his childhood tactics was used in the 2020 novel Little Christmas Town &#8212; the protagonist Amy escapes her attacker in the same way young Malcolm escaped his older brother locking him in the basement. Malcolm&#39;s brothers were the horror influence that jumpstarted his career &#8212; stories about &#8243;the man who roams around our neighborhood with a sign that says &#8243;I&#39;m looking for Malcolm&#8243;&#8243; or &#8243;the guy Dad hid under your floorboards and now haunts that room&#8243; inspired a will to understand and embrace the scary parts of the world. Malcolm graduated from the University of Tennessee with a bachelor's degree in Biological Anthropology (yes, and he&#39;s still a writer!) in 2017. After examining enough bodies, he understood himself to be a sensitive man who didn&#39;t want to see the gore up close. While working as a forensic researcher, he was fine-tuning two novels he began in college: <cite>Didn&#39;t Bring a Change of Clothes</cite> and <cite>Family Vacation.</cite> He found quick and lucky success in publishing in 2019, when both novels were sold to Random House. Malcolm felt like he was on the right path again, quitting his research and focusing full-time on his writing. Today, Malcolm still lives in his hometown and spends his time writing stories from a treehouse he built in the woods. No one knows the location of this treehouse except for his wife Marina. Her background in carpentry has afforded him immense luxurious upgrades for his hideaway, such as heated seats and refrigeration for snacks. If you find yourself in the Great Smoky Mountains and see a mysterious treehouse, proceed with caution.</p>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;Malcolm Hervey is claiming territory fast in the horror world. He has a style that&#39;s a unique blend of comedy and terror. Furthermore, he has a beautiful way of teaching the readers an important lesson throughout their journey with his characters. I have never read an author so dedicated to getting every side of the story and representing as many types of people in his novels as he can. A MUST on your TBR list&#8243; &#8211; John O&#39;Keefe of <cite>The New York Times,</cite> age 38, NY</p>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;I am excited for <cite>Jaywalkers</cite> more than any other release this year. Just based on the released sample, I know it&#39;s going to be the kind of psychological horror that tingles your spine and makes you double-lock your doors in case there&#39;s something scary out there. Maybe we should all be more like Megan?&#8243; Rhonda Meekins of <cite>The Brunchtime Show with Rhonda Meekins,</cite> age 52, CA</p>
