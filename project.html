		<p>Megan&#39;s troublesome past has led her to be a very cautious person. Her anxiety infects every aspect of her life, even the everyday tasks most people do not give a second thought. Getting up and getting ready for the day, making small talk with coworkers, making a morning commute&#8212;it&#39;s all a monumental task. When it comes to operating a vehicle, to her, it&#39;s not just a chore but unthinkable. After an unfortunate incident, Megan faces a more haunting hazard on the road than she could have ever imagined. She cannot escape from the torments of her own mind, coupled with whatever is lurking outside those yellow lines and just along the trees. Malcolm Hervey tells the horrific and suspenseful tale of a young woman named Megan, who is a hermit in her own right. Plagued with anxiety and antisocial tendencies, Megan doesn&#39;t have a singular person to come to her side when disaster strikes. As she becomes less willing to face what is in the outside world, we come to question everything just as she does. Is the coast clear? Is it safe? </p>
		<p class="pull_quote">&#8243;That <em>thing</em> is out there, watching me, taunting me, thinking it&#39;s so funny. I don&#39;t know what it is, but I do know what I am. A coward. And I&#39;m staying the hell at home. I&#39;ll grow my own food, I&#39;ll buy livestock, I don&#39;t care anymore&#8230;I&#39;m done.&#8243; </p></div></section>
