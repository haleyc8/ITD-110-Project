		<p>Christopher was a meticulous planner. He had booked the flight, the hotel room, and all the transportation. He packed himself, packed the kids, packed the car. He knew what was going to happen every second of every day while his family was away on vacation and he felt proud of the core memories that he was going to create for his children. Christopher and Jeanne had three kids, all beautiful angels sent from God, who could do no wrong and certainly would never show their father if they did. Olivia was five years old, John was 10, Julie was 14. While Dad sure liked to spend time with his entire family, but he knew that Julie was getting older and if she wanted to stay behind, he was going to have to let her. Christopher was hesitant to let his little girl go, but he promised to let her stay with her friend for the two weeks that the family was away if she earned it. </p>
		<p>Inez wasn&#39;t used to the toilets at her daughter&#39;s house. Being on this Earth for 83 years, she had come to realize one undeniable truth about life: the toilet in one&#39;s home is the best toilet. She watched the TV quietly next to Jane&#8212;her daughter had gone through back surgery and could not move on her own. Of course, Inez was not the person taking care of her, but it still felt nice to be needed as her mother. She was there more for emotional support than anything. She experienced a familiar pang in her stomach, notifying her that she had to go to the bathroom and as fast as possible. Removing the bed covers, she swung her feet over the edge of the high-top bed and slowly got on her feet. She found it difficult to get up and moving, but something in her guts was telling her that wasn&#39;t acceptable today. It all happened quite fast that afternoon. In squatting to the toilet, she overestimated the height, remembering the feel of her own at home. Her bowels emptied as she came down, anticipating a landing much higher than it truly was and feeling the dizzying effects of being a diabetic that hadn&#39;t eaten since the previous day. Landing hard on her right side in the small gap between the toilet and the bathtub, she continued to defecate as she fell. A dull thumb could be heard from the bathroom, but she did not cry out. She felt a degree of separation from the world around her as chaos ensued. &#8243;Mom? Mom!,&#8243; Jane yelled from the other room, unable to get up to check on her. Jane&#39;s children and daughter-in-law burst in. People were yelling, people were on the phone telling other family members to come quick, someone was in her face asking if she could move. She couldn&#39;t, but also did not feel confident enough to try. Am I dying?, she thought. Is that why everyone is so upset? She tried to tilt her head just enough to vomit on her right arm and on the base of the plunger whose home she was invading. Dying surely must be faster? </p>
		<p>I sat across from the nurse on a high examination table, her back turned from me. That moment, while lasting maybe 10 seconds, felt like an eternity. I felt a hollow lump in my chest, my skin growing hot and tingly with a severe sense of anxiety. My mom stood next to me, with a worried look on her face. That was the most worried I&#39;ve ever seen her. I thought she was probably more worried about if I was mad at her than if I was going to be safe for the next week. Another nurse loomed in the corner, wanting to be helpful but not having a task to complete. &#8243;Okay hun, I want you to take this and mark where you&#39;ve harmed yourself,&#8243; she said, handing me a piece of paper and a pen. I looked blankly at the page, having cried all I had in me. At this point, I was just exhausted. I saw a drawing of a girl&#39;s body, and I had a slow realization of what she was asking me to do. I circled the right arm and right thigh. This all felt so embarrassing. </p>
